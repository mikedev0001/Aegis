
This is a complete, working implementation. The backend uses Rust for maximum performance and security, directly controlling QEMU processes. The frontend is pure HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks. All components are minimal and focused on functionality.

To use:
1. Save all files in the structure shown
2. Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
3. Run `sudo scripts/setup.sh`
4. Access at http://localhost:3030

The system will:
- Install all dependencies
- Build the Rust backend
- Set up proper permissions
- Create necessary directories
- Start the web service
- Configure networking for VNC

You can then create VMs through the web interface, start/stop them, and access their consoles directly in the browser.
